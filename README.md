This is a Google Chrome extensions that takes text and parses it though the [AFINN-165 dataset](https://github.com/words/afinn-165) to tell how positive or negative the text is. 
It can parse text from an entire webpage, or, if text is selected, it will parse only highlighted text. 

The score is not necessarily indictative of the actual positivity of the text, moreso, it is an interesting measurement based on this dataset. 
However, it may be an interesting metric to see how the webpages you are visiting are affecting your daily mood. 
The AFINN-165 dataset is based on traditional usage of words and not necessarily accurate when compared to alternate or modern uses, especially with respect to profanity. 

This is something we did in about 4 hours because it seemed fun.
